rgRouter\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RiotGear/rg-router/master/demo/img/icon.png\" width=\"180px\" />\n\nRiotGear Router provides Riot apps with state based routes and URL management via the HTML History API.\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install riotgear-router --save\n```\n\nInclude the router in any tag you want to access the router from by \"mixin\" it in like so:\n\n```javascript\nthis.mixin('rg.router')\n```\n\nOnce you are happy to start the router call the [start()](#start) function from either a tag:\n\n```javascript\nthis.router.start()\n```\n\nor via the `rg` object:\n\n```javascript\nrg.router.start()\n```\n\n **The router does not start automatically.**\n\n## API\n\nAfter adding the router your tag will have access to the `router` via `this.router`.\n\n### Fluent API Interface\n\nIf you want you can chain function calls together. For example:\n\n```javascript\nrg.router.add().start().go()\n```\n\n### To #! or to not #!\n\nBy default the router uses `#!`, however you can change this easily by setting `rg.router.hash` to some other value.\n\n### `.add()`\n\nYou can add states at any point in time, on mount, on update, on click, on resolve of a promise...whenever.\n\n```javascript\nthis.router.add({\n  name: 'about',\n  url: '/about',\n  history: false,\n  resolve: () => new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n    window.setTimeout(resolve, 2000)\n  })\n})\n```\n- `name` is required, is the name of the state and the identifier to use when calling [go()](#go)\n- `url` is optional. It will update the browser URL on state change\n- `history` is optional. Set it to `false` to prevent the state from being added to your browser history\n- `resolve` is optional. The router will wait for `.then()` on the resolve function before going to the next state\n\nIf you do not specify a `url` the browser back and forward buttons will still work.\n\nStates names need to be unique. You can add a state with the same name but it will overwrite the state stored by the router.\n\n### `/:state/:parameters`\n\nYou can use template patterns like this:\n\n```javascript\nrg.router.add({\n  name: 'rest',\n  url: '/:collection/:id/:action'\n})\n```\n\nWhen the router starts it matches the URL with a state.\n\n`/users/470129/edit` will match against `'/:collection/:id/:action'`\n\nIf successful the router will create a `params` object on the state and copy the values across which you can gain access to via the `go` event.\n\ne.g.\n\n```javascript\nthis.router.on('go', state = > {\n  state.params.collection // users\n  state.params.id         // 470129\n  state.params.edit       // edit\n})\n```\n\nThe template can be anything you'd like, for instance `/about/:page` or `/alerts/:type/viewable`.\n\nA parameter is prefixed with `:`.\n\nWhen you call `go()` you can pass the state a params object that the router uses to construct the URL.\n\n### `inherit.state.data`\n\nYou can add whatever you want to a state and get access to it via `this.router.current` from within your tag, for example:\n\n```javascript\nthis.router.add({\n  name: 'about',\n  title: 'About our website' // this.router.current.title\n})\n```\n\nYou can also inherit the data from parent states by using dot notation in the state name:\n\n```javascript\nthis.router.add({\n  name: 'about.people'\n})\n```\n\nWhen you go to `about.people` you will still have the title value available via `this.router.current.title` that was set on the `about` state.\n\nThe `history` option is also inherited so if you want a child state to be part of the browser history reset it to true.\n\nBeware that the `resolve` function is also inherited. So if you navigate to a state whose parent is set to wait for a promise to resolve then the child will wait too. You can overwrite this by setting resolve to null on the child.\n\n### `.remove()`\n\n```javascript\nthis.router.remove('about')\n```\nJust as with adding, you can remove states whenever you want in the lifecycle of your application.\n\n\n### `.go()`\n\n```javascript\nthis.router.go('users', params)\n```\nCall `go()` if you want to change state. Calling go will update the current state, and if a URL is specified will update the URL on the browser.\n\nIf you specify a state name that doesn't exist the router will throw you an error.\n\nThe router will ignore attempts to go to the same state in succession.\n\n**Calling `go()` will trigger an update on any tag the router is on via the mixin**\n\nThe router will update the URL based on the template URL on the state and the structure of the `params` object.\n\n### `.stop()`\n\n```javascript\nthis.router.stop()\n```\nIf you want to stop the router and switch to use a different one this function will remove the event listeners and set `active` to false.\n\n### `.start()`\n\n```javascript\nthis.router.start()\n```\nOn start the router will check the URL, match it with a state and call `go()`. **The router does not start automatically**. Refreshing the browser will only return you to a state that has a URL. URL-less states can't be refreshed.\n\n### `.active`\n\n```javascript\nthis.router.active\n```\nCheck to see if the router is running or whether it has been stopped.\n\n### `.current`\n\n```javascript\nthis.router.current\n```\nCurrent state the router is in. This will contain everything specified on the state as part of the `add()` function.\n\n### `.on('add remove go start stop')`\n\n```javascript\nthis.router.on('add', state = > console.log(state))\nthis.router.on('remove', state = > console.log(state))\nthis.router.on('go', (current, previous) = > console.log(current, previous))\nthis.router.on('start')\nthis.router.on('stop')\n```\nThe router is an observable and will trigger an event for each of the above API calls.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"grumpywizards","email":"gregory.pratt@me.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-09-21T14:40:41.929Z","created":"2015-09-01T14:56:31.924Z","0.1.0":"2015-09-01T14:56:31.924Z","0.1.1":"2015-09-01T15:02:02.362Z","0.1.2":"2015-09-01T15:06:09.806Z","0.1.3":"2015-09-01T15:14:49.060Z","1.0.0":"2015-09-02T12:42:37.418Z","1.0.1":"2015-09-02T13:44:34.875Z","1.0.2":"2015-09-02T14:13:49.369Z","1.0.3":"2015-09-03T07:11:55.447Z","1.0.5":"2015-09-03T13:06:05.675Z","1.0.6":"2015-09-03T13:40:41.353Z","1.1.0":"2015-09-05T15:32:10.728Z","1.2.0":"2015-09-21T14:40:41.929Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/RiotGear/rg-router","keywords":["riotjs","riot","component","state","views","router"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/RiotGear/rg-router.git"},"author":{"name":"Gregory Pratt"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/RiotGear/rg-router/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"CK96HUUD05YMHVA35E04VZVB5\""}
